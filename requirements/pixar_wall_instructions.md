# Pixar Poster Creator Project Overview
This guide outlines the changes required to transform the existing Emoji Maker project into the Pixar Poster Creator application.

## General Changes
- **Rename the Project**: Everywhere in the codebase, change the name from "Emoji Maker" to "Pixar Poster Creator". This includes:
  - Landing pages
  - API routes
  - Other pages and components

## Feature Requirements
- **Model Update**: Use the following model from Replicate for generating posters:
  ```
  swartype/sdxl-pixar:81f8bbd3463056c8521eb528feb10509cc1385e2fabef590747f159848589048
  ```
- **Sample Input**: Ensure the input structure for the model is as follows:
  ```typescript
  input: {
      prompt: "A beautiful Pixar-style poster of a sunset over a mountain",
      negative_prompt: "", // Default to empty if negative prompt is disabled
      width: 1024,
      height: 1024,
      refine: "no_refiner",
      scheduler: "K_EULER",
      lora_scale: 0.6,
      num_outputs: 1,
      guidance_scale: 7.5,
      apply_watermark: false,
      high_noise_frac: 0.8,
      prompt_strength: 0.8,
      num_inference_steps: 50
  }
  ```

## UI Changes
- **Card Design**: 
  - Remove the white background from the cards.
  - Ensure the cards are large enough to display the posters clearly.
- **Responsiveness**: 
  - Make all components responsive to different screen sizes.
- **Negative Prompt Toggle**: 
  - Add a toggle switch below the input field for the prompt. 
  - If the toggle is enabled, send the default negative prompt for image generation; otherwise, keep it as an empty string.

## Profile Page Enhancements
- **Display Generated Posters**: 
  - In the profile page, in addition to transaction history and credit usage, show all posters generated by the logged-in user.
  - Design the layout to resemble a wall, similar to the mockup provided in `/wall-mockup.png`.

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure that all changes are thoroughly tested to maintain functionality.
- Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new project name and features.
